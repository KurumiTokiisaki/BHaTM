<div style="border: 10px solid white; width: 99%;"><p style="font-size: 80px; text-align: center;">Black Holes and Time Warps - Kip S. Thorne</p>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; margin: 50px; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">
    My primary source is ‘Black Holes and Time Warps’ by Kip S. Thorne, a renowned scientist from the Golden Age of physics. His book is an incredible collection of opinions and research from many scientists during 1950-1970. Deeming this my primary source, throughout my research stages I constantly took notes on anything new and did not know. But why did I enjoy this source so much?<br><br>

    Let’s discuss reliability. How reliable is this source? In the book, there are constantly footnotes for secondary sources of information. Any main sources are not taken from papers or essays, but rather from firsthand research and experience. Any context that is written is done so like a biography, showing that Kip Thorne experienced these firsthand research projects and experiences, contributing greatly to the honesty of this source. There is also another factor involved in honesty — opinion. Throughout the entire book, Kip Thorne compiles opinions and research of other scientists. This is different to excerpts written by scientists as they are usually self-centered and therefore likely biased, leading me to believe that this source is unbiased by crediting scientists other than himself.<br><br>

    Kip Thorne also does something unique – on occasions, he will admit that his theories were wrong. This is unusual for a scientist, especially when writing about themselves, which even further suggests that his book includes the progression made by other scientists. For example in 1971, when scientists Richard Hanni and Remo Ruffini discovered that a Black Hole can act as a massive battery by showing that a positively-charged metallic mass can polarize the hole’s horizon, in which Kip Thorne admits he was wrong by including the findings of scientists Roger Blandford and Roman Znajek in order to contradict himself. In this singular subtopic on Black Hole batteries, Kip Thorne mentions four scientists and explains their findings in great detail. It feels as though he is explaining their findings to a general audience where everyone can acknowledge that he always accepts the truth. And in doing so, always credits those who helped along the way.<br><br>

    As for the most useful content I’ve taken from this source, they include many things from the discoveries in the Golden Age.
    For example, Einstein’s equations of relativity in that Black Holes have no hair, meaning that any irregular shapes on the horizon will instantaneously be smoothed out back on to the event horizon. Or Einstein’s theory of relativity itself, countering Newton’s laws in that, proven using Kip Thorne’s race car analogy, which I took inspiration from in this artefact. It becomes clear that this source is targeted towards a general audience since it is full of relatable analogies to teach the reader concepts to greatly help prove Kip Thorne’s points as well as future points.

        The Golden Age (of Science)
        <li>Einstein (equations)</li>
        <dt>○ General Relativity</dt>
        <dt>○ ‘Black Holes have No Hair’</dt>
        <dd>■ Black holes do not have any flares or instabilities on the surface. Any such instabilities are quickly removed before they can have any effect on the event horizon.</dd>
        <dt>○ Black Holes’ rotational velocity increases with decreased event horizon radius</dt>
        <dd>■ A Black Hole’s orbit can never rip the event horizon as black holes have no ‘hair’.</dd>
        <dd>■ This spin energy is huge. A sun-sized black hole would be able to be farmed for 29% of its mass as (usable) energy since p = Ev / c²</dd>
        <li>Freeman Dyson</li>
        <dt>○ Electron Degeneracy</dt>
        <dd>■ Distance between electrons are so small that their vibrations alone produce enough energy to power a white dwarf.</dd>
        <dt>○ Neutron Degeneracy</dt>
        <dd>■ Distance between neutrons are so small that their vibrations alone produce enough energy to power a neutron star.</dd>
        <li>Chandrasekhar</li>
        <dt>○ White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars (density & formulae)</dt>
        <dd>■ White dwarves were said to be 61kg/cm³ in the 1920s, proven later to be 4,000kg/cm³ by Chandrasekhar.</dd>
        <dd>■ Chandrasekhar limit: A mass of a star >1.44 solar masses makes a neutron star, overcoming electron degeneracy and causing electrons to make neutrons with protons in atomic nuclei.</dd>
        <dd>■ White Dwarves are ‘white’ because they release all kinds of visible light from the high-frequency vibrations of electron degeneracy.</dd>
        <dd>■ Neutron Stars are deadly because they release an extreme amount of x-rays and gamma radiation from the extremely high-frequency vibrations of neutron degeneracy.</dd>
        <li>Schwarzschild</li>
        <dt>○ Schwarzschild radius: Radius of an object past which an event horizon will be formed, factoring mass, gravitational field strength, and the speed of light (2 * mass (geometrized) = radius).</dt>
        <li>Kip Thorne’s analogy on black holes forming as an ant colony</li>
        <dt>○ As more ants falling in a hole with food causes it to warp, data falling into a black hole can never escape</dt>
        <dt>○ This point is made when the event horizon is formed</dt>
        <dt>○ If, at the exact moment in which the event horizon is formed data is transmitted, it will forever orbit the surface of the event horizon</dt>
        <dd>■ The moment the horizon is formed, space will also forever orbit the horizon at the same speed at which it spins. This also causes matter to enter the hole in the same direction at which it spins.</dd>
        <li>John Wheeler: "Black Holes Pulsate"</li>
        <dt>○ Pulsations happen when ripples of spacetime curvature escape the black hole’s own spacetime curvature</dt>
        <dt>○ Pulsations in spinning matter cause the center of mass to be shifted accordingly (e.g. attaching a mass to a spinning helicopter blade causes it to flip)</dt>
        <dt>○ However, this cannot happen with black holes as they radiate away these pulsations (as gravitational waves) faster than the rate at which the pulsation is formed</dt>
        Discovering & Detecting Black Holes
        <li>The independent creation of a hole, and binary systems with two holes, radiate gravitational waves by throwing out some of their energy as gravitational waves</li>
        <li>These waves are a type of transverse waves that warps spacetime, causing length contraction and time dilation</li>
        <li>This length contraction can be detected by super-sensitive equipment on Earth, signaling the presence of gravitational waves</li>
        <dt>○ These waves were first picked up in LIGO on 14th September 2015, whereby the 4-kilometer long detection equipment recorded a length contraction of less than a thousandth the diameter of a proton</dt>
        <li>Time Warps</li>
        <dt>○ Wormholes are made from stable black holes with no event horizon</dt>
        <dd>■ Currently deemed as impossible as black holes experience ‘universal censorship’</dd>
        <dt>○ Traveling at relativistic speeds (>1/7th the speed of light so that Lorentz factor > 1.01) can result in a time warp</dt>
        <dd>■ Example on friend on ship traveling at 0.995c for 6 months away from Earth and back</dd>
        <dd>■ Would take 10 years in your time (Lorentz factor ~= 10 at 0.995c)</dd>
        <dd>■ Wormhole on ship will emit light from 9 years ago (in the ship’s frame), where upon entering this wormhole would result in time travel 9 years back</dd>
        <li>“Implosion to What?”</li>
        <dt>○ Neutron star formed at the core of the star (surpassing electron degeneracy), converting 10% of its mass into energy (e = mc², so the energy released would be insane)</dt>
        <dt>○ For reference, the sun would produce 10^46 joules in this moment (if it were to implode)</dt>
        <li>Chapter 10: Ripples of Curvature</li>
        <dt>○ A binary system of two black holes creates unique waves</dt>
        <dd>■ A binary system is where two objects orbit each other due to having similar masses</dd>
        <dt>○ These waves are formed when the hole throws out its own spacetime curvature as gravitational waves</dt>
        <dt>○ Lawn sprinkler analogy: just as a fast-spinning sprinkler shoots water, gravitational waves are shot out from this binary system</dt>
        <dt>○ The holes’ gravitational waves cause them to repel each other as they move closer, causing them to accelerate to near-light speeds</dt>
        <li>Chapter 11: What is Reality?</li>
        <dt>○ Black Holes can be used as power sources, and probably not in the way you’d think!</dt>
        <dt>○ Extracting their spin momentum or passing a ‘plasma load’ around the horizon causing voltage to force current flow</dt>
        <dt>○ Their horizons can also be used as excellent electrical batteries, conforming with all four laws of electricity & magnetism: Faraday's law of induction, Ampère's circuital law, Lenz' law, and the Lorentz force (from Motion Control Tips)</dt>
        <li>Black Holes evaporate</li>
        <dt>○ Black Holes don’t last forever – although information nor light can escape, Hawking radiation can</dt>
        <dt>○ Virtual particles are created due to the extreme conditions (strong gravity from extreme spacetime dilation) around a black hole</dt>
        <dd>■ This process is known as vacuum polarization (from Virtual Particles on Wikipedia)</dd>
        <dt>○ These virtual particles normally annihilate each other, conserving the mass of the Black Hole</dt>
        <dt>○ However, one of these halves sometimes escape into the universe while the other half falls back in</dt>
        <dt>○ This causes the black hole to lose mass/energy equal to the mass/energy of the released particle every time this phenomenon occurs</dt>
        <dt>○ The escapee is known as Hawking Radiation</dt>

        <li>As you approach very high speeds, the static external observer will see you redshift</li>
